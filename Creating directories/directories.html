<p><a class="p_ident" id="p_6UFSFAp8Vj" href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/20_node.html#p_6UFSFAp8Vj"></a>Add support for a method <code>MKCOL</code>, which should create a directory by calling <code>fs.mkdir</code>. <code>MKCOL</code> is not one of the basic HTTP methods, but it does exist, for this same purpose, in the <em>WebDAV</em> standard, which specifies a set of extensions to HTTP, making it suitable for writing resources, not just reading them.</p>

<p>Hint: You can use the function that implements the <code>DELETE</code> method as a blueprint for the <code>MKCOL</code> method. When no file is found, try to create a directory with <code>fs.mkdir</code>. When a directory exists at that path, you can return a 204 response so that directory creation requests are idempotent. If a nondirectory file exists here, return an error code. The code 400 (&ldquo;bad request&rdquo;) would be appropriate here.</p>

<p>You have to deliver the solution files to Git repository. You can use pre-defined unit tests located in test folder in your repository (you will need to change extension to.js in order to enable them)<br /><br />Ask your tutor if you have any questions.</p></body></html>
